<p>Hello! My name is Lauren Yuen and I am a Junior at Boston University studying Psychology and Innovation and Entrepreneurship. I have taken a recent interest in entrepreneurship as I currently work at a London-based startup called Assembly, which provides psychological and neuroscience-based tools to assist struggling parents manage their work-life balance. My interest in CS 103 stemmed from this, as the startup moves into the app design and website remodeling phase. Some other interests and hobbies of mine include yoga, longboarding, discovering new music, trying new foods, and writing. I also have a mini golden doodle named Otis whom I adore!</p>
